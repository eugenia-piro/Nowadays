                    But climate change's possible role is complicated: We know 
                    that the virus survives longer in cold temperatures than 
                    hot, so that could mean that a warmer planet would slow the 
                    spread of the disease, said meteorologist Jeff Masters, who 
                    writes for Yale Climate Connections. On the other hand, he 
                    said heat waves cause people to spend more time indoors in 
                    air-conditioned spaces, where the spread of the disease 
                    increases.

                    "We do know that climate change alters how we relate to 
                    other species on Earth and that matters to our health and 
                    our risk for infections," said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, 
                    director of Harvard University's T.H. Chan C-CHANGE program.

                    "As the planet heats up, animals big and small, on land and 
                    in the sea, are headed to the poles to get out of the heat,
                    " he said. "That means animals are coming into contact with 
                    other animals they normally wouldn’t, and that creates an 
                    opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts."

                    In addition, Masters said the diseases of most concern 
                    globally that are worsened by climate change are the ones 
                    spread by mosquitoes, since mosquitoes like it hot and wet 
                    – conditions that are becoming increasingly common because 
                    of global warming. Malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever 
                    and the West Nile virus are all expected to spread into 
                    areas where they currently are not endemic, he said. 
                    Tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease will also spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bernstein said climate change has already made conditions 
                    more favorable to the spread of some infectious diseases, 
                    including Lyme disease, waterborne diseases such as Vibrio 
                    parahaemolyticus (which causes vomiting and diarrhea) and 
                    mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.

                <p>
                    "Future risks are not easy to foretell, but climate change 
                    hits hard on several fronts that matter to when and where 
                    pathogens appear, including temperature and rainfall 
                    patterns," Bernstein said. "To help limit the risk of 
                    infectious diseases, we should do all we can to vastly 
                    reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 
                    1.5 degrees."

                    As for whether climate change could exacerbate future

                    environmental degradation and change (beyond what humans 
                    are already doing), then we are likely to see more of these 
                    diseases,"  he said. "But one could equally argue that we

                <h2>Climate change is a 'threat multiplier'</h2>
                <p>
                    One expert said that almost certainly, the impacts of pandemics such as COVID are exacerbated by climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meteorologist Michael Mann of Penn State University called 
                    climate change a "threat multiplier," meaning "it amplifies 
                    existing challenges and threats by increasing our 
                    vulnerability and reducing our adaptive capacity."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said to consider, for example, the situation in Puerto 
                    Rico, where many people have died of COVID-19 for the 
                    simple reason that they have not yet recovered, in terms of 
                    their public health infrastructure, from the devastating 
                    impacts of Hurricane Maria three years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "There is no doubt in my mind that the storm was made more 
                    destructive by unusually warm tropical Atlantic sea-surface 
                    temperatures, which provide more energy and moisture for 
                    the storm," Mann said. "This anomalous warmth can only be 
                    explained taking into account human-caused climate change."
                </p>

                        Planet is 'way off track' in dealing with climate 
                        change, UN report says
                    </a>                
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said a case can also be made for at least an indirect 
                    connection between COVID-19 and climate change. 
                    Environmental degradation, including deforestation, the 
                    destruction of rain forests and natural habitats for 
                    development may be displacing exotic disease-carrying 
                    creatures in a way that does favor increased human contact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "These same activities – deforestation in particular – are 
                    also leading to increased carbon emissions, which are 
                    behind human-caused climate change," Mann said.
