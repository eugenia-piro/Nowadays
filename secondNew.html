                Based on Patrick deWitt's absurdist 2018 novel, "French Exit" 
                follows Frances, a once-wealthy widow, and her adult son, 
                Malcolm (
                <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/10/29/boy-erased-star-lucas-hedges-every-movie-make-you-cry/1767003002/">

                ), as they flee New York when Frances learns she's insolvent. 
                They move into a friend's unoccupied Paris apartment along with 
                their cat, Small Frank (voiced by Tracy Letts), who goes 
                missing shortly after their arrival.
            </p>
            <p>
                We soon learn that Small Frank is actually Frances' 
                reincarnated husband. A decade earlier, Frances found her 
                husband's dead body and proceeded to go on a days-long ski trip 
                before contacting authorities, and neither the talking cat nor 
                Manhattan high society have let her forget it. But even on the 
                other side of the Atlantic, Frances is still confronted with 
                misery and mortality, while Malcolm must work through his own 
                romantic hangups brought on by his absent parents.

                The film is directed by Azazel Jacobs (2017's "The Lovers") and 
                written by deWitt, adapting from his book. Pfeiffer, 62, 
                recalls feeling drawn to the script's dark humor and 
                authentically human characters, despite the "odd world" they 
                inhabit.

                "I have found in my life, the most dire situations are 
                sometimes when people are at their funniest," Pfeiffer said 
                Friday afternoon in a Zoom conference with journalists. "When 
                my father died, when my mother died â€“ it's a way that people 
                release. It is a defense mechanism. So to me, (the film's 
                comedy is) not unusual. That's what makes it so real, actually."

                To play the drink-swilling, lavishly dressed Frances, Pfeiffer 
                says she drew from "friends who grew up in this world: New York 
                socialite, sort of elite. I'm a girl from Orange County, 
                California, and I always felt weirdly outside, especially when 
                they all got together. I always felt very pedestrian when I was 
                around them." 
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Batman Returns" actress gets an arsenal of acerbic 
                one-liners and deliciously vile moments. (In one memorable 
                scene, Frances lights a table on fire because the waiter is 
                taking too long with the check.) Pfeiffer, a three-time Oscar 
                nominee (last nominated in 1993 for "Love Field") calls "French 
                Exit" a "fun" career high point. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I would definitely put it in my Top 5 of wonderful filmmaking 
                experiences," she says. "The cast was so extraordinary, and 
                when you get that kind of writing and you're not struggling 
                with it, it just carries you. The tone was so specific and yet 
                so hard to describe."

                The "Scarface" star bonded early with on-screen son Hedges, 23, 
                a rising star best known for "Lady Bird" and his 
                Oscar-nominated role in "Manchester by the Sea." It helped that 
                they shot Frances and Malcolm's climatic emotional scene within 
                the first week of filming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "After that scene, I really felt like you were my mom," Hedges 
                told Pfeiffer Friday. "I felt like I didn't know you, and then 
                after that scene, I was in love with you. You won me over 
                completely. And I'm so glad that was like in the first week, 
                because I needed that early."
            </p>
            <p>
